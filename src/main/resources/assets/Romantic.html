<body>Description:
<p></p>
This mode should give the feeling of love with sentimental feeling
 
The color should be the range between the pink, purple, red, and the dark passion colors
The intensity should be low to let the user feel relaxed and don't disturb his/her eyes
It can be either:
·   	Continuous on as a stable color
·   	Or waving on the same color (dim the intensity and make it increase slightly)
·   	Or waving with the romance spectrum colors
And those states can be selected by the user on the UI but as default option when it accessed using the voice command the waving with the romance spectrum colors will be chosen.
