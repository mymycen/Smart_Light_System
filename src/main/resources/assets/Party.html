This mode should give the sensation of fast heartbeat with energy and fast flashing rate (on/off per minute)
 
The light should be a mix between bright and medium intensity distributed on the different lamps. For example, some lamps are medium intensity and changing to bright and the other lamps are bright and changing to medium intensity and this should be very fast.
The color should be changing all the time and could be chosen by user.
